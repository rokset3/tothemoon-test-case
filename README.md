# Test task

Basically you can track the of the task chronology from the notebooks, but I have short log what I have been doing & when so you can probably better understand how I was using time given to me

Unfortunately I could not allocate 100% of time I had, due to health & personal issues, but it is what it is.

### Wed 29.01.2025

* Did EDA & baselines (notebooks 1 & 2)

### Sunday 02.01.2025

* Did Arima & boosting with simple text

What wanted to try also
* More EDA & feature engineering (adding MACD-like signals and etc.)
* More time on text (I have not really checked the performance out-of-the-box of vaderSentiment, but manual 100-example observing seemed fine for me). Ideally I would love to fine-tune my own BERT using high deltas of target feature on text as labelling
* Explore possibilities of LSTM's/transformers (not good in prod lol) & RL
