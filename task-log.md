# Here I will present my general plans/ideas/general thoughts during such project


## Project plan

Generally speaking of project and my available time I plan to do the following steps

0) Eda
1) simple naive benchmarks
2) Arima/SARIMAX kinda stuff
3) boostings XGBoost/LightGBM/Catboost
4) add NLP features to boostings

optional from deeplearning if have time:

LSTM
Transformer (not likely to do actually, and I don't think it would work, but worth trying) on top of autoencoder of features
Try rl-based techniques

### To do on Wed Jan 29
* Do basic EDA, get to know with data and basic concepts 
* Create baseline benchmarks
* Try ARIMA/SARIMAX/prophet for TSA
* If have time, try boostings on all of the features
